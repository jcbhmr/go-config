# go-config
üêÆ GNU `config.guess` and `config.sub` wrapped in a Go module

## Installation

The CLI wrappers should work in all places where `config.guess` and `config.sub` normally work. **This notably excludes Windows.**

```sh
go install github.com/jcbhmr/go-config/cmd/...@latest
```

## Usage

There are two cmd binaries included in this project: `config.guess` and `config.sub`. `config.guess` will print out the current computer's target triplet. `config.sub` takes in a single argument and will try to match it against a list of well-known aliases and print out the full canonical target triplet.

## Why?

Because I wanted something portable that could serve as part of the Go toolchain. You can `go run` `config.guess` directly in a `//go:generate` comment or other script if you need to and it should just _work_. No need to fetch and maintain `config.guess` in your own repository when you can delegate that work to the Go dependency manager.

```go
// Some Go script somwhere...

func main() {
    // Can use the Go dependency instead of `./config.guess`.
    out, err := exec.Command("go", "run", "github.com/jcbhmr/go-config/cmd/config.guess")
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
    triplet := strings.TrimSuffix(string(out), "\n")
}
```
